# MicropythonCodes
 Micropython codes developed for model railway applications

## Introduction

I started to work with Micropython following Duncan Greenwood's talk on Micropython for CBUS.

I had not up until then thought of using Micropython for the Raspberry Pi Pico. I had concentrated instead on using the Arduino-Pico software.

I have started by getting a version of Duncan's code working for some of my Pico hardware for which I had found no Arduino-Pico solution.

I have had some success with that although I have yet to test it out with CBUS and have not developed a working application.

I do have some useful understanding and want to put the codes onto Github.

I am currently using Thonny to edit my codes.
